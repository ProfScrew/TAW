- If you want to use the generator for the electron app, you need to change in the script generate_angular_multi_platform the platform for which you want to generate the app

**How to use:**
- Change in general_config folder the route of the api in the environment file and the socket route in the socket file

- Launch the script with ```./generate_angular_multi_platform [--electron] [--cordova] [--all] [--clean] ```
